# lab-03


In this lab my colleague Narmeen Al-manaseer she helped me with the sort part. 
In zoom call she shared her screen and we had discuss her code and her way of think, then I write my code following her way.

I tryed to resolve the lab agin and I solve it with another way and I write down my notes under each function.
